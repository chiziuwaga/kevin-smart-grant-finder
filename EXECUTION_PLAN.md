# Advanced Grant Finder & Analysis System: Execution Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed execution plan for developing and implementing an advanced, multi-layered grant finding and analysis system. The goal is to enhance the grant discovery process through sophisticated context-aware filtering and to provide in-depth compliance and strategic analysis for ranking grant opportunities. This plan emphasizes a phased approach to ensure clarity, manage complexity, and facilitate thorough testing. Perplexity will be the sole external tool for grant sourcing and LLM-based enrichment.

## 2. Project Phases and Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Modeling ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective:** Establish the foundational configurations, data structures, and database schema necessary for the new system.

**Status:** All tasks completed successfully. Database schema finalized and all migration issues resolved.

**Completed Tasks:**
*   ✅ **Task 1.1-1.4:** Configuration files created (`kevin_profile_config.yaml`, `sector_config.yaml`, `geographic_config.yaml`, `compliance_rules_config.yaml`)
*   ✅ **Task 1.5:** `EnrichedGrant` Pydantic Model defined in `app/schemas.py` with `record_status` field
*   ✅ **Task 1.6:** Database Schema updated in `database/models.py` with new enrichment fields
*   ✅ **Task 1.7:** `ApplicationHistory` model and `ApplicationStatus` enum created
*   ✅ **Task 1.8:** Alembic migration generated and successfully applied
*   ✅ **Final:** Manual cleanup of legacy columns (`category`, `eligibility`, `notes`) completed

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Retained `grants.status` column (with `grantstatus` enum) for grant lifecycle tracking
- Mapped `grants.status` to `record_status` field in `EnrichedGrant` Pydantic model
- Successfully dropped legacy columns: `grants.category`, `grants.eligibility`, `analyses.notes`

            class Config:
                orm_mode = True
        ```
*   **Task 1.7: Update Database Schema (`database/models.py`)**
    *   **File:** `database/models.py`
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Modify `Grant` table:**
            *   Add fields to align with `EnrichedGrant` (e.g., `grant_id_external`, `summary_llm`, `funder_name`, `funding_amount_min`, `funding_amount_max`, `funding_amount_exact`, `application_open_date`, `eligibility_summary_llm`, `keywords_json`, `categories_project_json`).
            *   The existing `status` column (of `grantstatus` enum type: `ACTIVE`, `EXPIRED`, `DRAFT`, `ARCHIVED`) in the `grants` table will be **retained**. This field tracks the lifecycle status of the grant record itself, distinct from application statuses.
            *   Ensure `deadline` is `Date` type.
            *   Rename/adjust existing fields as necessary (e.g. `relevance_score` might be replaced by `overall_composite_score`).
        *   **Modify `Analysis` table (or create if not suitable):**
            *   This table might store the detailed scores from `ResearchContextScores` and `ComplianceScores`, linked to a `Grant`.
            *   Alternatively, these scores can be added directly to the `Grant` table if the relationship is always 1:1 and doesn't require historical tracking of analyses for the *same* grant entry. For simplicity, let's assume adding to `Grant` table for now, unless a separate `Analysis` entry per run is desired. If so, `Analysis` would link to `Grant` and store `research_scores_json` and `compliance_scores_json`.
            *   For now, let's plan to add score fields directly to the `Grant` model: `sector_relevance_score`, `geographic_relevance_score`, `operational_alignment_score`, `business_logic_alignment_score`, `feasibility_score`, `strategic_synergy_score`, `overall_composite_score`.
        *   **Create new `ApplicationHistory` table:**
            ```python
            # database/models.py
            # ... (other existing imports and models)
            from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, DateTime, ForeignKey, Text, Float, Date, Boolean, JSON
            # ...

            class ApplicationHistory(Base):
                __tablename__ = "application_history"

                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
                grant_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("grants.id"), nullable=False) # Assuming 'grants' is your Grant table name
                user_id = Column(String, index=True, nullable=False) # To link to user profile if multi-user later
                submission_date = Column(Date)
                status = Column(String)  # e.g., "Applied", "Awarded", "Rejected", "Withdrawn"
                outcome_notes = Column(Text)
                feedback_for_profile_update = Column(Text) # Notes on how this outcome should influence future searches
                created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
                updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.datetime.utcnow)

                grant = relationship("Grant") # Define relationship if Grant model is named "Grant"
            ```
*   **Task 1.8: Create Alembic Migration Script**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Run `alembic revision -m "implement_enriched_grant_and_history_schema"`
        *   Edit the generated migration file in `migrations/versions/` to reflect the schema changes from Task 1.7.
*   **Task 1.9: Apply Database Migrations**
    *   **Action:** Run `alembic upgrade head`. Verify schema changes in the database.

### Phase 2: `ResearchAgent` Refactoring

**Objective:** Refactor `ResearchAgent` to use the new 3-layered context system for grant discovery and enrichment, leveraging Perplexity.

*   **File:** `agents/research_agent.py`
*   **Task 2.1: Modify `ResearchAgent` Constructor**
    *   **Action:** Update `__init__` to load `kevin_profile_config.yaml`, `sector_config.yaml`, and `geographic_config.yaml`.
*   **Task 2.2: Robust Perplexity API Client Integration**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Ensure `utils/perplexity_client.py` (or equivalent) can robustly query Perplexity for grant opportunities based on dynamic search terms.
        *   Implement handling for pagination, rate limits, and error responses.
        *   Ensure it can return structured data (or data that can be easily parsed into a preliminary grant object).
*   **Task 2.3: LLM-based Grant Data Enrichment (Perplexity)**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement methods within `ResearchAgent` that take raw grant data (from Perplexity search or initial parsing) and use Perplexity's LLM capabilities to:
            *   Generate `summary_llm`.
            *   Extract/confirm `funder_name`, `funding_amount_min/max/exact`, `deadline_date`, `application_open_date`.
            *   Generate `eligibility_summary_llm`.
            *   Extract relevant `keywords` and `categories_project`.
        *   This step aims to populate the fields of the `EnrichedGrant` model.
*   **Task 2.4: Implement Sector Fusion Logic**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Create a method `_calculate_sector_relevance(grant_data: EnrichedGrant) -> float`.
        *   This method will use `sector_config.yaml` and grant details (title, description, keywords) to determine relevance to defined sectors/sub-sectors.
        *   Return a score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0).
*   **Task 2.5: Implement Geographic Intelligence Filtering**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Create a method `_calculate_geographic_relevance(grant_data: EnrichedGrant) -> float`.
        *   This method will use `geographic_config.yaml` and grant details (eligibility, location focus) to determine relevance.
        *   Return a score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0).
*   **Task 2.6: Implement Operational Context Synthesis**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Create a method `_calculate_operational_alignment(grant_data: EnrichedGrant) -> float`.
        *   This method will use `kevin_profile_config.yaml` (focus areas, expertise) and grant details to assess alignment.
        *   Return a score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0).
*   **Task 2.7: Update `ResearchAgent` Main Discovery Method**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Refactor the primary method (e.g., `discover_grants` or `run_research_cycle`).
        *   Orchestration:
            1.  Fetch initial grant leads using Perplexity (Task 2.2).
            2.  For each lead, enrich data using Perplexity LLM to form an initial `EnrichedGrant` object (Task 2.3).
            3.  Calculate sector relevance, geographic relevance, and operational alignment scores, populating `EnrichedGrant.research_scores` (Tasks 2.4, 2.5, 2.6).
            4.  Return a list of `EnrichedGrant` objects.

### Phase 3: `ComplianceAnalysisAgent` Implementation

**Objective:** Create a new `ComplianceAnalysisAgent` for advanced grant ranking based on a 3-layered validation matrix.
**Status:** FULLY COMPLETED. All tasks (3.1-3.7) successfully implemented. `agents/compliance_agent.py` is complete and functional.

*   **File:** `agents/compliance_agent.py` (New File)
*   **Task 3.1: Create `agents/compliance_agent.py`**
    *   **Action:** Create the new Python file.
*   **Task 3.2: Define `ComplianceAnalysisAgent` Class Structure**
    *   **Action:**
        ```python
        # agents/compliance_agent.py
        from app.schemas import EnrichedGrant # Assuming EnrichedGrant is accessible
        # Import YAML loading utilities, etc.

        class ComplianceAnalysisAgent:
            def __init__(self, compliance_config_path: str, profile_config_path: str):
                # Load compliance_rules_config.yaml
                # Load kevin_profile_config.yaml
                pass

            def analyze_grant(self, grant: EnrichedGrant) -> EnrichedGrant:
                # Orchestrate the 3 validation cycles
                # Calculate final composite score
                # Update and return the grant object
                pass
            
            def _calculate_business_logic_alignment(self, grant: EnrichedGrant) -> float:
                # Implementation for Task 3.4
                return 0.0

            def _calculate_feasibility_context(self, grant: EnrichedGrant) -> float:
                # Implementation for Task 3.5
                return 0.0

            def _calculate_strategic_synergy(self, grant: EnrichedGrant) -> float:
                # Implementation for Task 3.6
                return 0.0
            
            def _calculate_final_weighted_score(self, grant: EnrichedGrant) -> float:
                # Implementation for Task 3.7
                return 0.0
        ```
*   **Task 3.3: Implement Constructor**
    *   **Action:** Load `compliance_rules_config.yaml` and `kevin_profile_config.yaml` in `__init__`.
*   **Task 3.4: Implement Business Logic Alignment**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement `_calculate_business_logic_alignment`.
        *   Evaluate the `EnrichedGrant` against rules in `compliance_rules_config.yaml` (eligibility, reporting).
        *   This might involve keyword matching or more complex LLM-based interpretation if rules are complex.
        *   Return a score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) and store in `grant.compliance_scores.business_logic_alignment`.
*   **Task 3.5: Implement Feasibility Context Analysis**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement `_calculate_feasibility_context`.
        *   Assess grant feasibility based on `kevin_profile_config.yaml` (resource constraints, team capacity) and grant requirements (e.g., project duration, expected effort).
        *   Return a score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) and store in `grant.compliance_scores.feasibility_score`.
*   **Task 3.6: Implement Strategic Synergy Validation**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement `_calculate_strategic_synergy`.
        *   Evaluate long-term strategic fit using `kevin_profile_config.yaml` (strategic goals, focus areas) and grant objectives.
        *   Return a score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) and store in `grant.compliance_scores.strategic_synergy`.
*   **Task 3.7: Implement Final Weighted Score Calculation**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement `_calculate_final_weighted_score`.
        *   Combine scores from `ResearchAgent` (`grant.research_scores`) and the three validation cycles from `ComplianceAnalysisAgent` (`grant.compliance_scores`) using a predefined weighting scheme.
        *   Example: `overall_composite_score = (0.2 * sector_relevance) + (0.1 * geo_relevance) + (0.2 * op_alignment) + (0.2 * biz_logic) + (0.15 * feasibility) + (0.15 * strategic_synergy)` (Weights to be tuned).
        *   Store the result in `grant.overall_composite_score`. Update the `analyze_grant` method to call this and return the fully scored `EnrichedGrant`.

### Phase 4: Backend Integration

**Objective:** Integrate the refactored `ResearchAgent` and new `ComplianceAnalysisAgent` into the backend services, CRUD operations, and APIs.

*   **Task 4.1: Update `app/crud.py`**
    *   **Status:** Partially completed. Key functions updated and unblocked.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Modify `run_full_search_cycle` (or its equivalent, e.g., a function called by the `/search` endpoint):
            *   Successfully integrated `ResearchAgent` and `ComplianceAnalysisAgent`.
            *   Ensured `EnrichedGrant` objects are processed through both agents.
            *   Logic for saving/updating fully scored `EnrichedGrant` data to the `DBGrant` model in the database is implemented.
            *   Resolved previous syntax errors that were blocking progress.
        *   Update/create functions like `get_grant_by_id`, `get_grants_list` to fetch and return `EnrichedGrant` objects, including all new fields, scores, pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities. These are now implemented.
        *   Update `fetch_stats` and `fetch_distribution` to use new fields from `DBGrant` (e.g., `overall_composite_score`, `identified_sector`, `deadline_date`). These are now implemented.
*   **Task 4.2: Update `app/schemas.py` for API Responses**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Ensure API response schemas (e.g., `GrantResponse`, `PaginatedGrantResponse`) are updated to correctly serialize and return `EnrichedGrant` data, including nested score objects.
*   **Task 4.3: Update `app/router.py` (API Endpoints)**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Modify existing endpoints (e.g., `/search`, `/grants`, `/grants/{grant_id}`):
            *   Ensure they use the updated CRUD functions.
            *   Ensure they expect/return data according to the updated `EnrichedGrant` schema.
        *   Create a new API endpoint for submitting application feedback:
            *   **Endpoint:** `POST /applications/feedback`
            *   **Request Body:** Schema for `grant_id`, `submission_date`, `status`, `outcome_notes`, `feedback_for_profile_update`.
            *   **Action:** Saves data to the `ApplicationHistory` table.
        *   Consider if `ComplianceAnalysisAgent` needs a separate trigger endpoint or if it's always part of the main search cycle. For now, assume it's part of the main cycle.

### Phase 5: Recursive Correction Mechanisms

**Objective:** Implement mechanisms for learning from application outcomes and evolving user profiles to refine grant discovery and analysis over time.

*   **Task 5.1: `ApplicationHistory` Table Usage Design**
    *   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   **Action:** Confirm the `ApplicationHistory` table (Task 1.7) captures necessary data for feedback.
*   **Task 5.2: Implement CRUD for `ApplicationHistory`**
    *   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   **File:** `app/crud.py`
    *   **Action:** Add functions to create, read, update, and delete entries in `ApplicationHistory`. The `create` function will be used by the API endpoint from Task 4.3.
*   **Task 5.3: Develop Initial Manual Process for Grant Success Pattern Analysis**
    *   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (Process Defined)
    *   **Action:** This is a process definition, not direct code implementation. The following steps outline the manual review and configuration update cycle:
        1.  **Define Review Cadence:**
            *   Establish a regular schedule for reviewing `ApplicationHistory` data.
            *   **Recommendation:** Monthly, or quarterly if application volume is low. Adjust as needed.
        2.  **Data Collection & Preparation:**
            *   Extract relevant data from the `ApplicationHistory` table. This might involve querying for all entries within the review period, focusing on those with definitive outcomes (e.g., "Awarded", "Rejected").
            *   Collate feedback notes, reasons for status, and any `feedback_for_profile_update` text.
        3.  **Pattern Analysis & Insight Generation:**
            *   **Successful Applications:**
                *   Identify common characteristics of grants that were "Awarded":
                    *   Sectors, sub-sectors, or specific project types.
                    *   Funder types or specific funders.
                    *   Grant amount ranges.
                    *   Alignment with specific aspects of `kevin_profile_config.yaml` (e.g., expertise, strategic goals).
                *   Analyze `feedback_notes` for insights into why these were successful.
            *   **Unsuccessful Applications:**
                *   Identify common reasons for "Rejected" or "Withdrawn" applications:
                    *   Mismatch with eligibility criteria not caught by the system.
                    *   Feasibility concerns (e.g., resources, timeline).
                    *   Strategic misalignment.
                *   Analyze `status_reason` and `feedback_notes` for explicit rejection reasons.
            *   **Profile Feedback Review:**
                *   Examine `feedback_for_profile_update` entries. Assess if these suggestions are actionable and how they align with observed success/failure patterns.
        4.  **Manual Configuration Updates (Iterative Refinement):**
            *   Based on the analysis, manually update the relevant YAML configuration files:
                *   `config/kevin_profile_config.yaml`:
                    *   Refine user's focus areas, expertise keywords.
                    *   Update strategic goals or priorities.
                    *   Adjust resource availability or constraints if they were a factor in feasibility.
                *   `config/sector_config.yaml`:
                    *   Adjust keywords or scoring weights for sectors/sub-sectors that show high success rates.
                    *   Add new emerging or niche sub-sectors if identified.
                    *   Deprioritize sectors with consistently poor outcomes if a clear pattern emerges.
                *   `config/geographic_config.yaml`:
                    *   Update priority regions or location-specific keywords based on successful applications or identified opportunities/limitations.
                *   `config/compliance_rules_config.yaml`:
                    *   Add new critical eligibility criteria if patterns of rejection highlight missing rules.
                    *   Adjust the importance or interpretation of existing compliance rules.
                    *   Refine parameters that contribute to feasibility scores if rejections indicate miscalibration.
            *   **Documentation:** Briefly document the changes made to configurations and the rationale based on the review period's findings. This can be a simple log or notes.
        5.  **Monitor Impact:**
            *   Observe the system's performance in subsequent grant search cycles to see if the configuration changes lead to improved relevance and success rates.
*   **Task 5.4: (Future Enhancement) Document Potential Future Automation**
    *   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (Future Enhancements Documented)
    *   **Action:** Document potential future automation strategies for the recursive correction mechanism. This involves outlining how the manual steps in Task 5.3 could be augmented or replaced by automated processes.
        *   **1. LLM-Powered Feedback Analysis & Suggestion Generation:**
            *   **Concept:** Develop a new agent or a module within an existing agent (e.g., a "LearningAgent") that uses an LLM (like Perplexity) to analyze text fields from `ApplicationHistory` (`outcome_notes`, `feedback_for_profile_update`, `status_reason`).
            *   **Functionality:**
                *   **Identify Key Themes:** Extract recurring themes, keywords, and sentiments from successful and unsuccessful applications.
                *   **Suggest Configuration Changes:** Based on identified themes, propose specific, actionable changes to the YAML configuration files (`kevin_profile_config.yaml`, `sector_config.yaml`, etc.). For example, if multiple rejections mention "lack of X requirement," the system could suggest adding a rule to `compliance_rules_config.yaml` or a keyword to `kevin_profile_config.yaml`.
                *   **Drafting Assistance:** The LLM could draft suggested modifications in the YAML format, which the user can then review and approve.
            *   **Benefit:** Reduces manual effort in parsing qualitative feedback and translating it into configuration updates.
        *   **2. Statistical Correlation Analysis for Scoring Weight Adjustment:**
            *   **Concept:** Implement a system to statistically analyze correlations between grant characteristics, `ApplicationHistory` outcomes (`is_successful_outcome`), and the scores assigned by `ResearchAgent` and `ComplianceAnalysisAgent`.
            *   **Functionality:**
                *   **Identify Predictive Features:** Determine which grant features (e.g., specific keywords, funding amounts, identified sectors) and which internal scores (e.g., `sector_relevance_score`, `feasibility_score`) are most strongly correlated with successful applications.
                *   **Automated Weight Tuning:** Based on these correlations, the system could suggest adjustments to the weighting scheme used in `_calculate_final_weighted_score` (in `ComplianceAnalysisAgent`) to give more importance to factors that consistently lead to success.
                *   **Threshold Adjustments:** Suggest modifications to filter thresholds (e.g., `min_overall_score` for display) based on historical success rates at different score levels.
            *   **Benefit:** More data-driven and potentially more optimal tuning of the scoring and ranking system.
        *   **3. Automated Anomaly Detection in Grant Outcomes:**
            *   **Concept:** Monitor `ApplicationHistory` for anomalies, such as a sudden drop in success rates for previously reliable grant types or funders.
            *   **Functionality:**
                *   **Alerting System:** Notify the user of significant deviations from expected outcomes.
                *   **Diagnostic Support:** Potentially provide initial hypotheses for the anomalies (e.g., "New compliance rule from Funder X may be impacting eligibility").
            *   **Benefit:** Proactive identification of issues or changes in the grant landscape.
        *   **4. User Interface for Managing Suggested Changes:**
            *   **Concept:** If automated suggestions are generated (from LLM analysis or statistical analysis), the dashboard should provide an interface for the user to review, approve, modify, or reject these suggestions before they are applied to the configuration files.
            *   **Functionality:**
                *   Display suggested changes with explanations/rationales.
                *   Allow user to accept/reject individual changes.
                *   Provide a "dry run" or impact preview if feasible.
            *   **Benefit:** Keeps the user in control while leveraging automation for efficiency.
        *   **Implementation Note:** These are future enhancements. Initial focus remains on the manual process. The complexity of these automated systems would require significant additional development.

### Phase 6: Frontend Updates & System Testing

**Objective:** Update the frontend to display new grant information, integrate new functionalities, and conduct comprehensive system testing.

*   **Task 6.1: Update Frontend Components (e.g., `Dashboard.js`)**
    *   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js` and other relevant files.
    *   **Action:**
        *   ✅ Modified API calls to fetch grants to align with new backend response structures (`EnrichedGrant`).

            *   Detailed scores (sector, geographic, operational, business logic, feasibility, strategic synergy, overall composite).
            *   LLM-generated summaries (`summary_llm`, `eligibility_summary_llm`).
            *   Funding amount details.
        *   ✅ Implemented filters based on the enriched data (score ranges, sector filtering).
        *   ✅ Backend API endpoints fully integrated and tested.
        *   ✅ Frontend successfully connecting to backend with EnrichedGrant data structure.

## 3. Conclusion

This execution plan provides a structured approach to developing the advanced grant finding system. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for iterative development and testing. Adherence to this plan, coupled with regular communication and review, will be key to a successful implementation.

## 4. Housekeeping: Files for Future Cleanup

This section lists files that were generated during development (e.g., backups, temporary files) and should be considered for deletion once they are no longer needed to avoid confusion and keep the repository clean. Provide a detailed list of other file types that are not needed or have been made obsolete. 

*   `config/settings.py.new`
*   `config/settings.py.old`
*   `config/settings.py.tmp`
*   Review other `*.tmp` or `*.bak` files if any exist.
