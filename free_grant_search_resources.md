# Sample configuration for telecom grants
telecom_params = {
"search_terms": ["broadband deployment", "rural connectivity"],
"filters": {
"funding_type": ["grant", "cooperative agreement"],
"eligible_entities": ["nonprofits", "municipalities"],
"geo_restrictions": "LA-08"
},
"sources": ["Grants.gov", "USDA", "State portals"],
"alert_rules": {
"match_score": ">85%",
"deadline_window": "30 days"
}
}
# Women-owned nonprofit configuration

○ Apply meeting-derived weights: 70% local/30% federal
2. Automated Triage System
○ Priority 1: Grants matching both telecom + shelter criteria14
○ Priority 2: Women-owned grants with fast turnaround (<45 day deadlines)8
3. State-Specific Harvesting
○ Configure scraper for: sql
SELECT * FROM louisiana.gov
WHERE ("grant" IN title)
AND ("telecom" OR "shelter" IN description)
